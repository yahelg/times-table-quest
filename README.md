Times Table Quest
=================

An interactive multiplication practice game built as a single HTML page. Drill standard times tables, challenge yourself against the clock, or work on factor recognition — all with instant feedback and friendly visuals.

Features
--------

- Practice mode with randomized multiplication questions within a configurable range.
- Timed two-minute challenge that tracks accuracy, streaks, and score.
- Smart weighting so “easy drills” (×1, ×10, ×2 up to 5, and 3×3) appear no more than 10% of the time.
- Factor challenges that only accept factors below 10, keeping questions focused on mental math.
- Sound effects, answer history, and keyboard shortcuts for a smooth practice flow.
- Header version badge (`vX.Y.Z`) so you can confirm the build you’re running — bump `APP_VERSION` in `index.html` with each release.

Getting Started
---------------

Open `index.html` in any modern browser—no build step or dependencies required.

Tips
----

- Press `Enter` to submit your answer, or `R` to skip to a new question during practice.
- Adjust the “Practice range” and “Factor challenges” sliders to tailor the session to your level.
